This guide is intended to help navigate the structure of the RO and provide assistance with interpreting it. Note that we expect very few users will need to peruse the whole ontology in its entirety. Most people will encounter RO through some subset that is used within another ontology. For example, a user browsing Uberon may see a develops from relationship linking two classes. Clicking on this may lead to a resource such as OntoBee, where more details can be found. In fact many users may not need to be aware of RO at all: the ontology may be used behind the scenes to calculate results. However, we expect some users may have a need to browse the whole ontology. These include ontology developers or data modelers looking to reuse relations. Here some additional guidance may prove useful. Details How to browse RO In order to fully comprehend RO it is necessary to inspect it using a tool that supports the entirety of the OWL2 language. In practice this means Protege 5, a desktop application. The best web-based way to browse RO is through OntoBee or OLS. However, RO sometimes uses constructs not supported by OntoBee or OLS, and sometimes OntoBee fails to display the full hierarchy. However, OntoBee provides one advantage over Protege: each relation can be browsed in the context of its usage. We recommend use of Protege, sometimes complemented by OntoBee. For Protege, like all OBO ontologies, the ontology should be accessed via its purl, i.e. http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ro.owl (or if you want to see the bleeding edge version you can check out this repo and use ro-edit.owl) In order to best understand RO, it helps tremendously to be familiar with OWL2. This advice does not necessarily hold for looking at RO through an application-specific prism: here the best way to view RO will be dictated by the application and the domain. However, when looking at the entire ontology understanding OWL2 will definitely help. At a minimum, it helps to know: How to read ManchesterSyntax The difference between an ObjectProperty and an AnnotationProperty The meaning of Object Property Characteristics, such as 'Transitive' The meaning of Object Property Axiom types, such as SubPropertyOf What a PropertyChain is What it means to import an ontology It also helps to know some of the practices of the OBO Community. For example: naming conventions ID policy and URI structure (also: Identifiers ). Use of the IAO metadata vocabulary Finally, for browsing in Protege, we recommend a tutorial such as the Pizza tutorial. A few additional tips help: Hovering over an axiom reveals its ontology source (RO imports parts of other ontologies) Using a reasoner will show you entailed axioms A colored \"@\" means the axiom has annotations (e.g. provenance of the axiom). Click on the \"@\" to see these If at this stage you are undaunted, read on! Logical Design Patterns RO makes use of a number of logical ontology design patterns (ODPs). These crop up repeatedly, so it can help to be aware of these. Note that each usage of an ODP should be documented directly in the ontology as well as here. Direct and Indirect forms of relations The following pattern shows up a lot: * \"<R>\" (a Transitive OP) * \"directly <R>\" (non-transitive) And occasionally extended to this: * \"<R>\" (a Transitive OP) * \"directly <R>\" (non-Transitive) * \"indirectly <R>\" (Transitive) The first thing to point out is that the structure is sometimes confusing to users coming from an Object-Oriented Programming perspective. The intuition is that characteristics of the parent should be inherited as characteristics of the child. In fact this is not the case: the direct form of a transitive relation is both a subproperty of the transitive form, and itself non-transitive. This can be seen with a specific example, e.g. http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002202 develops from http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002207 directly develops from Here the 'direct' prefix means that the two structures or classes should be in direct succession (no intermediates). Consider a structure: A directly-develops-from B directly-develops-from C (e.g. A is a limb, B is a limb bud, and C is a limb primordium). From the above, we can infer: 1. A develops-from B develops-from C 2. A develops-from C (1) follows from SubPropertyOf, and (2) follows from (1) and the transitivity axiom. In RO, every usage of this ODP should have an is direct form of annotation; e.g. directly develops from is-direct-form-of 'indirectly develops from'. Note that we do not always create an indirect relation as sibling to the direct form. This is in part because inference of the indirect form can be problemmatic. Note that RO does not include a 'directly part of' relation. For a discussion see: https://keet.wordpress.com/2010/11/14/nontransitive-vs-intransitive-direct-part-whole-relations-in-owl/ Defining Property Chains involving Reflexivity The pattern here is * \"<R> <P>\" <- R o P * <R> When this ODP is used, the property chain axiom should be tagged with an is a defining property chain axiom where second argument is reflexive axiom. In this case, the parent relation is a grouping relation for query purposes. Consider: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002177 'attached to part of' http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002371 'attached to' Consider a ligament or tendon attached to some projection P that is part of a bone B, that is part of the limb skeleton. We may be interested in all attachmed structures for any part of the body, and this named property chain provides a convenient way of querying for it. In all cases of this ODP, the parent property can be safely 'unfolded' away with no loss of information. i.e. expanded to an actual chain with two property expressions or assertions. The placement of the base form as a child of the parent is justified via the local reflexivity of the 2nd argument. Local Reflexivity In many formal treatments of relations, the Reflexivity characteristic is frequently used. For example, in mereology, 'part of' is frequently characterized as reflexive. This can seem confusing when compared with everyday usage (no one typically considers an object to be part of itself). However, it is convenient from the point of view of mathematical formulation. A 'proper R' sub-relation is often introduced, e.g. 'proper part of'. (We typically do not include a 'proper' form of the relation. This is because it inflates the ontology, and complicates reasoning. Also, it does not actually add information or provide real utility or intuition). We rarely if ever declare a relation to be reflexive. Reflexivity is incompatible with domain and range assertions. Consider: ObjectProperty: P Characteristics: Reflexive Domain: C Class: C DisjointWith: D reflexivity of P literally means that every individual in the domain stands in a P relation to itself. This would include any instances of D. However, it an instance of D cannot be the subject of a P relation, hence D is unsatisfiable. This is rarely a concern in formal treatments, where a restricted domain is assumed; however, RO covers all domains so full reflexivity is almost always inappropriate. Instead, here we would make use of a 'local reflexivity' axiom. E.g. ObjectProperty: P Domain: C Class: C DisjointWith: D SubClassOf: P Self In practice we may not have asserted all cases of local reflexivity (TODO: tracker link). Interaction Relations It can be useful to have relations that are shortcuts for more detailed modeling using processes. For example, to model two organisms interacting, we may use an 'interaction' process, with the organisms linked via participation relations. We can then subclass the interaction process class to describe different kinds of interaction. It can also be convenient to have relations that 'shortcut' across the process, e.g. x interacts-with y, x phosphorylates y, x hunts y. The way we do this is via the introduction of 'helper properties'. Unfortunately these clog up the ontology from a browsing perspective, but assist with reasoning. The design pattern is documented here: http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:N-Ary_Relation_Pattern_%28OWL_2%29 For every interaction process Proc we create as isProc ObjectProperty that is locally reflexive for any instance of Proc, ie Class: Proc SubClassOf: isProc Self ObjectProperty: isProc SubPropertyOf: 'helper process' (the subPropertyOf axiom does not affect the logic, it exists purely for aesthetic purposes) We can now define property chains using this 'fake' property, e.g. ObjectProperty: RelProc SubPropertyChain: 'partner in' o isProc o inv('partner in') See also: InteractionRelations Shortcut Relations See: ShortcutRelations Annotation Assertions in RO In RO we aim to have comprehensive metadata for each ObjectProperty declared. In practice we often fall short, but this is something we are striving to improve. Metadata is provided via annotation assertions using annotation properties (APs), and other object types, from a variety of ontologies, including: IAO/metadata dublin core RDFS OboInOwl We have also defined APs within RO. Some of these may migrate to IAO. Definitions Like all OBO ontologies, definitions are provided using an http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115 'definition' AP. We strive to give each OP a definition. In practice we may omit definitions for OPs that are trivially the inverse of another defined OP (TODO link to tracker). Definition Source and Attribution Notes curator notes: aimed at curator users of ontologies editor notes: primarily internal notes for other RO editors, but exposed for the sake of transparency Synonyms and alternate terms 'OBO foundry unique label' is used where the primary label could potentially be ambiguous when compared to other ontologies. Provenance and Attribution We currently use IAO 'term editor' APs to record a literal with the full name of the person who added the term to the ontology. The IAO def of this is: \"Name of editor entering the term in the file. The term editor is a point of contact for information regarding the term. The term editor may be, but is not always, the author of the definition, which may have been worked upon by several people\" We may decide to use ORCIDs in future. NOTE: we have recently switched to using the created_by tag as this is supported directly in Protege. We need to go back and standardize use of some of these properties. Curation Status Organization of Relations into Domain Modules One of the first things a user may notice on browsing RO is it contains a number of highly specific relations particular to sub-domains of science. This can be disconcerting, especially as (for logical reasons), the hierarchies can be mingled. For example, sub-relations of generic relations 'part of' or 'precedes' include specific neuroanatomical relations mixed with environmental relations. In general, typical users would not be exposed to this variety: a neuroanatomist should consume a RO module intended specifically for neuroanatomy. This section deals with how RO is organized into domains, and how these modules are extracted. Imports RO imports a handful of portions of other ontologies, primarily in order to specify domain and range constraints. In practice, some external ontologies are not properly imported: portions of the ontologies are copied directly into RO. This is something we will resolve in future (TODO tracker link). RO uses BFO classes as an upper level ontology; this is imported from the RO-core module (next section): RO/core One of the most important modules in RO is the module called RO-core. It has its own URI: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ro/core.owl And is documented separately ROCore . It can be consumed independently of RO. RO/core aims to faithfully follow the BFO2 reference document. There is ongoing discussion on representation of the temporal aspects of BFO. For more information see: ROCore ROAndBFO ROAndTime Domain Specific Modules We currently support two overlapping mechanisms to partition RO into modules according to application or domain. Grouping relations Subsets Grouping relations are OPs that form the root of a property hierarchy including the desired properties. For example, 'developmentally related to' (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002324) groups all OPs used to specify developmental relationships between two structures. All such grouping relations should be tagged with a 'curator note' property describing the intent of the grouping, and warning not to use the OP in logical assertions. There are some objections to grouping OPs. Philosophically there are objections that the OP does not represent a true relationship in the world. However, in practice there are no negative consequences of this philosophical infelicity - the OP can simply be ignored. A more serious objection may be that the presence of these relations can slow down reasoning. If this turns out to be a problem we may find another strategy. Despite these objections, grouping relations are undeniably convenient for browsing in an ontology browser like Protege. With the grouping strategy, all subproperties are included in the group. Sometimes it is desirable to cherry pick certain OPs independently of the subProperty hierarchy. Here we explicitly assert membership in a group. Currently this is done using the 'in subset' AP from the OiO vocabulary. This may be changed to IAO in future, but for now use of this vocabulary has advantages for mapping to obo format and making use of OORT to build releases - subset files are generated as part of the release process. Currently we only have a single subset, ro-eco, but we will add more later, e.g. for RONeuro . One possibility is to have an editor in charge of the content of each module (or at least representing a community of stakeholders).

I: Influence Influence pertains to whether or not the causal relation is regulatory; direction pertains to the directionality of the change of magnitude of the target. The influence is either regulatory or non-regulatory I = {R,N} A regulatory influence (R) is a causal relation that can be switched on or off to achieve some objective: for example, a cell regulating levels of a cytosolic chemical through the switching off of a GTPase with a GTPase inhibitor. A non-regulatory influence (N) is the complement of this, and is exemplified by two successive steps in a pathway, where the output of the first is required as input for the second. Although the relationship is causal, it is not regulatory as the required input for the second step is not purposefully withheld (or provided); the cell does not use this as a control mechanism. (Note that we assume influence one way or another; the algebra does not permit non-influential/causal relations; these could be done separately using Allen). The following primitive rules hold: R o R \u2192 R R o N \u2192 R N o R \u2192 R N o N \u2192 N i.e. regulation is \u2018infectious\u2019. Note this may seem excessively permissive: a single regulatory link in a very long chain of causal relations renders the entire chain causal. We leave it to individual applications to determine both the degree of causal influence and the extend to which a regulatory component contributes. This may be via probabilistic or quantitive reasoning. This is outside the scope of this symbolic boolean algebra which seeks merely to determine logical potential. Direction The direction is positive, negative or undeclared/neutral/generic Direction = {+1, -1, 0} Although all actual regulatory relationships have a direction, we include the zero state here to assist with defining a formalism that accounts for unknown states. The primitive property chains are obtained through arithmetic multiplication; e.g. +1 \u2218 +1 \u2192 +1 +1 \u2218 -1 \u2192 -1 -1 \u2218 +1 \u2192 -1 -1 \u2218 -1 \u2192 +1 0 \u2218 _ \u2192 0 _ \u2218 0 \u2192 0 Here \u2018_\u2019 is a wildcard, and direction can be inserted. Directness For any pair of atomic activities p and q, if p has some causal influence on q then it can only stand in two possible directness relationships to q D (aka direct): if there is a physical interaction involving participants of p and q I (aka indirect): p precedes q, if there is NO physical interaction involving participants of p and q Cross-Product Our set of causal relations is therefore drawn from T \u00d7 I \u00d7 D The following names are used for members of the cross-product directly positively regulates \u2192 <D,R,+1> directly negatively regulates \u2192 <D,R,-1> indirectly positively regulates \u2192 <I,R,+1> indirectly negatively regulates \u2192 <I,R,-1> regulates \u2192 <*,R,0> positively regulates \u2192 <*,R,+1> negatively regulates \u2192 <*,R,-1> directly provides input for \u2192 <D,N,+1> indirectly provides input for \u2192 <I,N,+1> provides input for \u2192 <*,N,+1> immediately causally upstream of \u2192 <D,*,0> TODO: add PURLs for the above. Note that unidirectional implication is used to leave open the use of different terms for the same members of the cross-product when applied to different domains. We also use the following sub-relations when both p and q are elemental (in the case of GO, these are GO MFs): directly activates \u2192 directly inhibits \u2192 indirectly activates \u2192 indirectly inhibits \u2192 Composition rules Composition rules for the cross-product follow naturally from the individual composition rules of the individual elements. We can also derive: regulates o part_of \u2192 regulates (DEPRECATED) ends_with o regulates \u2192 regulates The first follows from our rules above: processual part of is (if p is part of q it is playing some causal role in it).

One important consideration is that in OWL-DL there is no complete way to infer the more specific form from the general form. This means that if different ontologies are to work together then they must all agree on a particular level, otherwise inferences will be incomplete. For example, if Ontology O1 has: BloodPressure EquivalentTo pressure and quality-of some blood And Ontology O2 has: Individual: bp001 Types: pressure and inheres-in some blood then bp001 will NOT be inferred to be an instance of BloodPressure Of course, inferences over subPropertyOf will be complete. i.e. we can infer the super property from the sub property, just not the reverse.

This is not ideal for many users, who typically require a small subset of these. Dividing into domain-specific modules One approach would be to divide the RO into a collection of domain-specific modules - for each ro-neuro, ro-developmental-biology, etc. These modules could import one another where appropriate, and a parent ro ontology could import everything. We decided against this at this stage, since it will difficult to tell a-priori which were sensible divisions. There are many ways to partition into mutually exclusive sets - by upper level (e.g. process-process relations vs process-continuant) or by domain. Many domains overlap. We may still pre-modularize the relations at some stage in the future, but for now they are organized as a single ontology (or rather as two: with the core relations in BFO and derived and domain specific relations in RO) Extracting Modules As the RO is not modularized in advanced, it would be useful for users to have ways to extract the modules they need. Automatic Module Extraction There are a number of ways to automatically extract a module from an ontology - the OWLAPI implements some of these. You can use the OWLTools command line facility to access the OWLAPI and it's modularization capabilities. Using 'develops from' as a seed using the TOP strategy: owltools ro.owl --extract-module -m TOP 'develops from' -o file://`pwd`/ro-subset-part-of.owl Using 'part of' and 'has part' and all their descendant relations: owltools ro.owl --extract-module -m STAR 'has part' 'part of' -o file://`pwd`/ro-subset-part-of.owl Getting the right module requires an understanding of the modularization algorithm which is non-trivial - particularly where this interacts with ShortcutRelations - in future we will provide a more intuitive high-level modularization capability. Manual Module Extraction Another method is to manually take the properties and/or related axioms one requires and copy them into the working ontology. This technique is not ideal, but the operation is relatively infrequent since most ontologies do not use large numbers of relations.

For example, a cell can be part of the neuroepithelium at one time, and then detached from it at a later time. This is an important consideration in anatomy ontologies . For a detailed treatment, see the original RO paper . Unfortunately the relations in this paper are difficult to represent directly in OWL. Our current strategy is to use \"atemporal\" binary relations such as part_of with the understanding that the spirit of the RO paper should be followed - i.e. any class axioms such as \"nucleus SubClassOf part_of some cell\" should be understood to hold true for any \"snapshot\" in time. We are currently working on a more formal treatment. One possible approach is to use 'temporalized relations', but this suffers from problems, and the RO is unlikely to adopt these in the near future. See this critique of BFO2 for more details. A more promising approach is either a separate interpretation or TemporallyQualifiedContinuants , but work on this proposal has not yet been completed. Rough Sketch of Approach The spirit of the approach is to treat class axioms in OWL as if they had the same meaning as class-level relations in RO2005. For example: (1) Class: nucleus SubClassOf: part_of some cell Is equivalent to writing the following FOL: (2) forall n : instance_of(n,Nucleus) -> exists c : instance_of(c,Cell) part_of(n,c) But our goal is to provide a temporal interpretation consistent with the original RO paper , as follows: (3) forall t : forall n : instance_of(n,Nucleus,t) -> exists c : instance_of(c,Cell,t) part_of(n,c,t) What is currently lacking are global generic rules that can be applied for any OWL axiom - class axiom or instance axiom. Whilst these are being developed, this rough sketch provides some guidelines. The basic idea for class axioms that use the part_of relation is: assume a \"forall t\" quantifier surrounding the direct FOL translation of the OWL. In addition, the same \"t\" variable should be added for all property assertions where a temporal argument is required. For example, the the OWL class axiom (1) above has the direct meaning: By applying the transformation specified roughly above, we move from (2) to(3). There will be exceptions to this patterns, these will be documented in the relations themselves. Inline Documentation Many RO relations are annotated with a \"temporal interpretation\" property: RO_0001900 \"temporal interpretation\" This connects an OWL object property to documentation describing how the relation should be interpreted. This is best seen from within Protege. However, it is partially visible in OntoBee - see for example http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050 - currently the description \"axiom holds at all times\" is not hyperlinked. Other examples The Gene Ontology (extended version) contains axioms such as: (1) (part_of some Nucleus) DisjointWith (part_of some mitochondrion) This has a direct interpretation that is atemporal: (2) not exists i, n, m: part_of(i,n) & part_of(i,m) & instance_of(n,Nucleus) & instance_of(m,Mitochondrion) Applying the rule above we get: (3) forall t : [ not exists i, n, m: part_of(i,n,t) & part_of(i,m,t) & instance_of(n,Nucleus,t) & instance_of(m,Mitochondrion,t) ] This is equivalent to saying \"there are no times at which there is anything that is both part of a nucleus and part of a mitochondrion\".
